## C++ Mini Projects

Assorted mini projects that I am making to practice C++.

Any helpful feedback is welcome! Some of my uploads will be in response 
to course assignments, others may be things I put together myself as a 
test or exploration of concepts. I am currently a student and would be
more than happy to receive constructive advice. Thanks for looking!

My main personal work is on a larger scale project, currently titled [World Builder Alpha](https://github.com/ardunster/WBA), this repo is only for C++ learning projects.
