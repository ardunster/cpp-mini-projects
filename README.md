## C++ Mini Projects

Assorted mini projects that I am making to practice C++.

Any helpful feedback is welcome! Some of my uploads will be in response
to course assignments, others may be things I put together myself as a
test or exploration of concepts. I am currently a student and would be
more than happy to receive constructive advice. Thanks for looking!

My main personal work is on a larger scale project, currently titled [World Builder Alpha](https://github.com/ardunster/WBA), this repo is only for C++ learning projects.

## ParticleFire

This is my favorite project so far in the repo. It was the final project for a
C++ beginners course I had on Udemy, and uses the SDL library to produce a neat
explosion animation with a swarm of particles. I wouldn't consider it production
code, but I did put a bit more polish into that code (and better comments)
compared to the pieces of code that are strictly experimental and practice
oriented.
