# Particle Fire Explosion

Final project for the [C++ for Beginners
course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101qKkBkQZcVlXRn4=/).

## Requirements

Built using [SDL 2.0.12](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php). Development
done on a Mac with library installed in the Library/Frameworks folder.
Currently, you will have to hand-edit the Makefile to specifcy a different
location for the SDL library.

## Possible future experiments

Once I wrap up this course I'll be moving on to other projects, but in the
future I may want to make some experimental changes to this project. Some ideas
that might be fun to tackle:

- Set up to take command line arguments for:

  - Window size
  - Number of particles
  - Speed of particles
  - Whether or not we randomly reinitialize particles
  - Blur before or after particle update

- Randomly change the size of the swarm while running
- React to music or audio playing

No promises on any of these, but I wanted to organize my ideas in case I decide
to come back to them later. :)
